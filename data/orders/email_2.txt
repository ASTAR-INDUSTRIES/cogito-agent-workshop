Good morning,

I hope you are doing great! I’d like to place an order:

1. Ballpoint pens – Blue, 50 pieces.
2. Notebooks (A4 size) – 10 pieces.
3. Printer cartridges, color ones, maybe two or three?

Could you please deliver them to 789 King Street, Floor 3 by the end of this week? I’ll confirm the cartridge models later.

Best regards,  
Mike
