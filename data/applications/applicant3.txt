Hello, my name is Michael Wang. I’ve spent 6 years in the field of data science, mostly focused on applying business intelligence and analytics. I have a solid foundation in Python and SQL, and I enjoy working on predictive modeling projects. I’ve worked on a project that improved sales forecasting and drove a 10% increase in revenue for the company. With a Master’s in Computer Science, I’m always aiming to align technical data insights with broader business strategies. I’m interested in this position because I want to apply my experience on more diverse and complex projects.
