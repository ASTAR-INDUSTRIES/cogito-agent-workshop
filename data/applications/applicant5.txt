Hello, I’m David Lee, I’ve been working in data science for about 5 years now, mainly focusing on natural language processing (NLP). I have hands-on experience with Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Recently, I worked on building NLP models for sentiment analysis, which improved customer retention by 12%. I have a Master’s in Data Science, and I’m looking to expand my horizons beyond NLP and delve into predictive analytics, which is why this job really caught my eye.
