Hi there, I’m John Smith, I’ve been working in data science for about 7 years now. For the last 5 years, I was a senior data scientist at TechCorp. My expertise lies in Python, TensorFlow, and machine learning, and I’ve done a lot of work with time series forecasting too. I also have a PhD in Computer Science. One of my proudest moments was leading a team to build a recommendation system that boosted product discovery by 15%. I’m really excited to apply for this position because I want to dive deeper into predictive analytics and deploying models at scale.
