Hey, Sarah here! I’ve been working with data and machine learning for around 4 years. I’ve mainly been with smaller companies, helping them build models for fraud detection and data analysis. My go-to tools are Python and scikit-learn, and I also love using Tableau for data visualization. I have a Master's in Data Science, and one of my recent projects involved developing a fraud detection system that hit 92% accuracy. I’m looking for bigger challenges and feel like this role will allow me to work on projects with larger impacts.
