Hi! I’m Emily Davis and I’ve been a Senior Data Scientist for 8 years, mostly in the e-commerce sector. My main strengths are deep learning and data visualization. I’ve also worked with Python and TensorFlow extensively. I completed a PhD in Machine Learning and my last project was a demand prediction model that helped reduce stockouts by 20%. I’m looking to branch out into other industries, and I think this role is the perfect opportunity to apply my skills in new and challenging ways.
